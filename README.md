# Power EnJoy - An Electrical Car-Sharing Service
## Politecnico of Milano - Software engineering 2
In this repository we are going to describe with some documents an hypothetical electrical car-sharing system that can take place in the city of Milano. This was the project of the course Software engeneering 2 at the Politecnico of Milano.
## Getting Started
You can check the task by looking the document [Assignments AA 2016-2017.pdf](https://github.com/istoony/softeng/blob/master/RELEASE/RASD/Assignments%20AA%202016-2017.pdf) in the RELEASE/RASD folder
The first document that we wrote was the RASD (Requirements Analisys and Specifications Document) you can see two different versions of this document in the RASD floder. The second version include some fix that we did not identify during the first requirement analysis.


The final document is a .docx document
All changes can be seen on the ononymous .md document
