# Power EnJoy - An Electrical Car-Sharing Service
## Politecnico of Milano - Software engineering 2
In this repository we are going to describe with some documents an hypothetical electrical car-sharing system that can take place in the city of Milano. This was the project of the course Software engeneering 2 at the Politecnico of Milano.
## Getting Started
You can check the task by looking the document [Assignments AA 2016-2017.pdf](https://github.com/istoony/softeng/blob/master/RELEASE/RASD/Assignments%20AA%202016-2017.pdf) in the RELEASE/RASD folder
* The first document that we wrote is the RASD (Requirements Analisys and Specifications Document) you can see two different versions of this document in the RASD floder. The second version include some fix that we did not identify during the first requirement analysis.
* The second document that we wrote is the DD (Design Document) that describe how the system sould be designed.
* The third document that we wrote is the ITPD (Integration Test Plan Document) that describe how the test should be made to test the all application.
* The fourth document that we wrote is the PPD (Project Plan Document) that describe the estimation of the effort of the main component of the system. 
* The last document is the GANTT that describe the time that is required to develop the application.
